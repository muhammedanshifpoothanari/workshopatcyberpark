# To keep things organized, let's create a folder for this workshop . 


Create a file named `introduction.js`:

```
touch introduction.js
```

Or if you're on Windows: 
```
type NUL > introduction.js
```
(`type` is part of the command!)

Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:

```js
console.log('hello')
```

Save the file, then check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

```
node verify introduction.js
```

By the way, throughout this tutorial, you can give the file you work with any name you like, so if you want to use something like `catsAreAwesome.js` file for every exercise, you can do that. Just make sure to run:

```
node verify catsAreAwesome.js
```
